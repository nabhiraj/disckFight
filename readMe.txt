its a two player game
in this game we do not have direct control of the disks
we can just increase of decrease the velocity in a specific direction.
green disk works with arrow keys
blue disk works with w,a,s,d for incrementing velocity
colliding with the disk with a higer speed will damage the disk's life
colliding with boundry will damage the disk's life.
survie longer than your opponent and damage his disk by gaining speed while protecting yourself.
