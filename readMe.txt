its a two player game
in this game we do not have direct control of the disks
we can just increase or decrease the velocity in a specific direction.
green disk works with arrow keys
blue disk works with w,a,s,d for incrementing velocity
colliding with the disk with a higher speed will damage the disk's life
colliding with the boundary will damage the disk's life.
survive longer than your opponent and damage his disk by gaining speed while protecting yourself.
